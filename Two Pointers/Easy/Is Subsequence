PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
392. Is Subsequence
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string 
by deleting some (or none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions 
of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

SOLUTION APPROACH:
This solution uses a simulation of the Two-Pointer (Greedy) approach.

1. We iterate through every character in string 's' (the potential subsequence).
2. For each character in 's', we search through string 't' to find a match.
3. Crucially, we maintain a variable 'j' which tracks our current position in 't'.
   The inner loop always starts searching from 'j' rather than 0. This ensures that 
   we respect the relative order of characters (we cannot pick a character in 't' 
   that appears before our previous match).
4. When a match is found (t[h] == s[i]):
   - We increment the match counter 'k'.
   - We update 'j' to 'h + 1' so the next search begins strictly after this match.
   - We break the inner loop to move to the next character of 's'.
5. Finally, if the match counter 'k' equals the length of 's', it means we found 
   all characters in the correct relative order.
