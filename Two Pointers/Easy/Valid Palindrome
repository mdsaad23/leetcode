LeetCode - Valid Palindrome
Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric 
characters and ignoring cases. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other 
sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

SOLUTION APPROACH:
1. Remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string
2. Convert the string to uppercase for case-insensitive comparison
3. Use two pointers to compare characters from both ends moving toward the center
4. If any pair of characters don't match, it's not a palindrome
5. If all pairs match, it's a valid palindrome
