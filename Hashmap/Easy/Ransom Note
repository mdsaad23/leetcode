PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
383. Ransom Note

Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed 
by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

Example 1:
Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true

SOLUTION APPROACH:
This solution uses a Frequency Map (Hash Map) to count available characters.

1. Dictionary Initialization: Create an empty dictionary 'b' to serve as a frequency counter.
2. Build Frequency Map: Iterate through the 'magazine' string.
   - If a character is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
   - If not, add it with a count of 1.
   This tells us exactly how many of each letter we have available to use.
3. Verification: Iterate through the 'ransomNote' string.
   - Check if the current character exists in our dictionary 'b'.
   - If it exists but the count is 0, we have used all instances of that letter. Return False.
   - If it exists and count > 0, decrement the count (consume the letter).
   - If the character is not in the dictionary at all, return False.
4. Result: If the loop completes without returning False, it means we successfully found 
   all characters needed. Return True.
