PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
205. Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving 
the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a 
character may map to itself.

Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false (because 'o' cannot map to both 'a' and 'r')

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

SOLUTION APPROACH:
Bi-directional Mapping Strategy.

To ensure two strings are isomorphic, we must enforce a One-to-One (Bijection) relationship. 
This requires checking two conditions simultaneously:

1. Forward Mapping (s -> t): Every character in 's' must consistently map to the same character in 't'.
   - We use dictionary 'k' to store these mappings.
2. Reverse Mapping (t -> s): No two distinct characters in 's' can map to the same character in 't'.
   - We use dictionary 'm' to ensure that a character in 't' hasn't already been claimed by a different character in 's'.

If we find any inconsistency in either direction during the loop, we return False.
